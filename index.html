                    Purrgil is a simple wrapper for Docker stuff that help you to manage a mult-container enviroment. After read a little about Docker Orchestrators and projects that use Docker to manage your enviroments I noticed that some people have a single repository with a docker-compose.yml and an init.sh to make all project work aright and use orchestrators only to deploy your application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ideia of Purrgil is help you construct this enviroment, help you to provide across your stages and the principal: Give you more flexibility and power to use docker in development enviroment!
