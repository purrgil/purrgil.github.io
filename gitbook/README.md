# Introduction

Purrgil is a simple **wrapper**/**orchestrator** for Docker stuff that help you to manage a mult-container enviroment. After read a little about Docker Orchestrators and projects that use Docker to manage your enviroments I noticed that some people have a single repository with a `docker-compose.yml` and an `init.sh` to make all project work aright and use orchestrators only to deploy your application.

The ideia of **Purrgil** is help you construct this enviroment, help you to provide across your stages and the principal: Give you more flexibility and power to use docker in development enviroment!

# Why Purrgil?

### Easy to maintain!

You don't need any of the many scripts that usually people create to manage your environments, or any internet boilerplate. A simple configuration file and a bunch of commands is all that you need.


### Abstract to gain time!

If you need a hand, we will give you some tentacles haha. Is not a complex thing that we do here, but a simple thing that all of us use all moments.


### Isn't prod first

Purrgil wasn't create thinking in Production environment, they was born for create and manager development mult-container's environment. Production features are only a plus.
